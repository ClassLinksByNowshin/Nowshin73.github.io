 Implementation of the RSA Calculator using Simple Javascript Program.
This repository contains the  Javascript implementation of the RSA Algorithm, including selection of p & q, checks e of public key[e,n] is relative prime of r=(p-1)*(q-1) or not, determines d of private key [d,n],
convert message (max 8 letters) to cipher text and revert cipher text to message.
